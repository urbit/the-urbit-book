> The first step in the reverse design process is figuring out who your audience is. One way to do this is to write two or three learner personas. This technique is borrowed from user experience designers, who create short profiles of typical users to help them think about their audience.

**Bruce** is an engineer with a strong background in math and physics but not much programming.  He finds Urbit interesting because a lot of his friends think it's important and compelling, but he hasn't actually looked into the technology much yet.  He wants to know what Urbit can actually do, and how to replace what people normally do on the web with this new tool.  This book will help Bruce to use Urbit as a way of organizing and presenting his digital life.

**Astrid** is an artist who is drawn to Urbit's cyberpunk possibilities.  She is intrigued by the postcorporate vision of Urbit:  not crypto so much as intellectual freedom and bohemian values.  Astrid is ambitious to use Urbit for performance art, generative art, and exploring new concepts.  She is technical enough to use MetaMask and no more, but she's enthusiastic to learn.  This book will help Astrid to use Urbit to express her creative vision without reliance on corporate tools.
